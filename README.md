# cpp_containers_bymyself
In this project, i implemented a few container types of the C++ standard template library.

## Project Overview
This project aims to deepen your understanding of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) by implementing several commonly used container types from scratch. By doing so, you will gain insights into the inner workings of these containers and improve your C++ programming skills.

## Containers to Implement
- **Vector**: A dynamic array that can resize itself automatically when elements are added or removed.
- **List**: A doubly linked list that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.
- **Map**: An associative container that stores key-value pairs with unique keys.
- **Set**: A container that stores unique elements in a specific order.

## Goals
- Understand the underlying data structures and algorithms used in STL containers.
- Implement the containers with similar interfaces and functionalities as the STL counterparts.
- Write test cases to ensure the correctness and performance of your implementations.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and run Make file to compile.
